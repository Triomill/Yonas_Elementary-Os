# System Call: getdents()
The getdents() system call reads several directory entries from a file descriptor into a user-provided buffer. It returns data in a low-level format and is used internally by commands like ls. It allows programs to list files in a directory without high-level libraries. Requires careful handling of raw binary data and is replaced in modern code by higher-level functions like readdir() for safety and simplicity.
